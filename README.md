## Password Manager for all your passwords.
Lots of accounts and lots of passwords? Hard time managing them all.
Just use these scripts to save your passwords on your local machine securely.

All the passwords will be encrypted using AES and then saved to SQLite database so no one can snoop.

apt-get install pycrypto
```
